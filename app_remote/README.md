# What is this folder about?
It is where we hold the redaction service. The service is developed using **Flask** and would be hosted locally for testing. If the test goes successfully and the performance of ML component is decent (there will be an accurate definition of decent!), will consider to move it to cloud, i.e. served with AWS.

# More coming soon!
